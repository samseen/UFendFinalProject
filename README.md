# Travel App Project

## Overview
This project requires me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## What I'm supposed to build
The project includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast.

The APIs I consumed from include Pixabay, Dark Sky and Geonames.

I extended my project further by pulling the images of the location entered from Pixabay and displayed the one with the most hits from that country.
